/// Calculates the capabilities of the Calcite system.
///
/// The `calcite_capabilities` function returns a `CapabilitiesResponse` struct
/// that represents the capabilities of the Calcite system. The `CapabilitiesResponse`
/// contains the version of the Calcite system and various capabilities in different
/// aspects such as query, mutation, and relationships.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use some_library::calcite_capabilities;
///
/// let capabilities = calcite_capabilities();
/// println!("{:?}", capabilities);
/// ```
///
/// # Returns
///
/// - `CapabilitiesResponse`: A struct representing the capabilities of the Calcite system.
